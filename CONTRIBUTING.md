# Contributing

Contributions must preserve the strict public/private boundary described in [PUBLIC-SCOPE.md](PUBLIC-SCOPE.md).

Before opening a pull request:

```bash
npm ci
npm run safety
npm run lint
npm run build
npm audit
```

Do not submit production code, data, unapproved screenshots or media, logs, environment files, account identifiers, operational documentation, or copied history. Every permitted binary must be explicitly reviewed and integrity-locked in `public/asset-manifest.json`. Public issues and pull requests are permanently unsuitable for sensitive reports; use the process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
